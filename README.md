# PV Now

The codebase for our senior design project. 

PV Now is an app for on-campus vendors at PVAMU to better market and promote their products and events to students. It will also serve as a space for students to connect with vendors and be informed about what vendors will be present in the Memorial Student Center on Hump Day, which is every Wednesday.
